Key Features ==========

- Add PSU test script for runTest
- EnvironmentControl: Add CC/CV control to PSUs 
- EnvironmentControl: Add Enable/Disable to PSUs
- Add PSU dependencies (e.g. PSU X must be enabled before PSU Y)
    - Config stored in EnvironmentConfig
    - Handled by _PSU in EnvironmentControl
    - Best to measure actual output voltage rather than trust setting
- Add Tamalero tests
    - Settings stored in TestSettings (under Criterion)
    - Handled by new class in EnvironmentControl
    - Will require calling existing Tamalero scripts
    - Monitor/measure output and eval PASS/FAIL?
- Add interlock + DAQ tests
    - Config stored in EnvironmentConfig (under new classes)
    - Settings stored in TestSettings (under Criterion)
    - Handled by new class in EnvironmentControl
    - Will require calling custom scripts for controlling interlock, due to the
        unlimited variety of methods for toggling a physical pin
- Add support for PSU control over AnaGate CAN
    - For us, specifically AnaGate CAN over IP
    - i.e. protocol = "IP", interface = "AnaGate (CAN)"
- TBD: Add cold box control
    - Will again require calling custom scripts to keep things generalized

QoL Features ==========

- EnvironmentControl: Add log verbosity
- EnvironmentControl: Add print colors
